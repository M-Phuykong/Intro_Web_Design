        Dakar, city, capital of Senegal, and one of the chief seaports on the western African coast.
        It is located midway between the mouths of the Gambia and Sénégal rivers on the
        southeastern side of the Cape Verde Peninsula, close to Africa’s most westerly point.
        Dakar’s harbour is one of the best in western Africa, protected by the limestone cliffs of
        the cape and by a system of breakwaters. The city’s name comes from dakhar, a Wolof
        name for the tamarind tree and the name of a coastal Lebu village that was located south
        of what is now the first pier.

        Dakar is one of tropical Africa’s leading industrial and service centres. Its industries
        include peanut-oil refining, fish canning, flour milling, brewing, truck assembly, and
        petroleum refining. Many cultural institutions are located in Dakar, such as the Grand
        National Theatre of Dakar; the Daniel Sorano National Theatre; the Théodore Monod
        African Art Museum, a museum of the Fundamental Institute of Black Africa (Institut
        Fondamental d’Afrique Noire; IFAN) that focuses on the anthropology and art of Africa;
        and the Museum of Black Civilizations, which has a large collection of African cultural
        artifacts.
