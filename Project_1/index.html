            <h2>Nigeria</h2>

            <p>
                Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a country in West Africa.
                It is situated between the Sahel to the north and the Gulf of Guinea to the south in the Atlantic Ocean.
                It covers an area of 923,769 square kilometres (356,669 sq mi), and with a population of over 230 million,
                it is the most populous country in Africa, and the world's sixth-most populous country.
                Nigeria borders Niger in the north, Chad in the northeast, Cameroon in the east, and Benin in the west.
                Nigeria is a federal republic comprising 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where the capital, Abuja, is located.
                The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and the largest in Africa.

            <h2>Historical Information</h2>
            <p>
                Lagos was occupied by British forces in 1851 and formally annexed by Britain in the year 1865.
                Nigeria became a British protectorate in 1901. The period of British rule lasted until 1960 when an independence movement led to the country being granted independence.
                Nigeria first became a republic in 1963, but succumbed to military rule after a bloody coup d'Ã©tat in 1966.
                A separatist movement later formed the Republic of Biafra in 1967, leading to the three-year Nigerian Civil War.
                Nigeria became a republic again after a new constitution was written in 1979.
                However, the republic was short-lived, as the military seized power again in 1983 and later ruled for ten years.
                A new republic was planned to be established in 1993 but was aborted by General Sani Abacha.
                Abacha died in 1998 and a fourth republic was later established the following year, 1999, which ended three decades of intermittent military rule.

                The estimated population for Lagos was more than 26 million in 2023; and around 30 million for the Lagos metropolitan area.
                Lagos is the most populous urban area in Africa. Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until December 1991 following the government's decision to move their capital to Abuja in the centre of the country.

                The city has been described as the cultural, financial, and entertainment capital of Africa, and is a significant influence on commerce, entertainment, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, and fashion.
                Lagos is also among the top ten of the world's fastest-growing cities and urban areas.
                The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent.
                The Lagos metropolitan area is a major educational and cultural centre in Sub Saharan Africa.
                Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity.
