        Jakarta, the bustling capital of Indonesia, is a cultural melting pot. A diverse mix of
        traditions, from Javanese and Malay to Arab, Indian, and Dutch swirl together in this
        megalopolis. The result is a dynamic, lively city with its own intriguing flavor.

        You'll discover that Jakarta has the world's best coffee scene, and most socializing in the
        city takes place at trendy cafés – not lounges. You'll find yourself craving the fried rice
        found at Jakarta's countless street food stalls – and develop friendships with the chefs.
        And you'll end up in the city's glitzy, multipurpose shopping malls for retail therapy, along
        with entertainment, events, and art.

    <h6 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Indonesia</h6>
    <p style="color: #454545;">
        At the heart of Bogor are the fabulous botanical gardens, known as the Kebun Raya; the
        city’s green lung covers 87 hectares. Everyone loves the Orchid House with its exotic and
        delicate blooms, but there are more than 15,000 species of plant here including 400
        different kinds of palm (don't miss the footstool palm, which tops out at an impressive
        25m). There are lots of graceful pandan trees and some huge agave and cacti in the
        Mexican section.

    <p style="color: #454545;">
        It is here that Jakartans come to take a breather from the traffic. The figurative centre of
        Jakarta, Merdeka Square (merdeka means independence) is actually a trapezoid measuring
        almost 1 sq km. In the 19th century, the Dutch called it Koningsplein (Kings Square) and
        it became a focal point for the city after they moved the government here from old Batavia
        (Kota). It's always had an important role in local life. The main entrance is on the south
        side.

    </a>
    <h6 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Indonesia</h6>
    <p style="color: #454545;">
        This puppet museum has one of the best collections of wayang (flat wooden puppets) in
        Java and its dusty cabinets are full of a multitude of intricate, eerie and beautiful
        characters from across Indonesia, as well as China, Vietnam, India, Cambodia and
        Europe. The building itself dates from 1912. Ask about the occasional free wayang
        performances.
